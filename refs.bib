                SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

Increasing levels of physical activity is recognized as a strategic pathway to achieving the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Research can support policy makers in evaluating strategies for achieving this goal. Barriers limit the capacity of researchers in LMICs. We discuss how global research capacity might be developed in public health by supporting collaboration via Open Science approaches and technologies such as Science Gateways and Open Access Repositories. The paper reports on how we are contributing to research capacity building in Ghana using a Science Gateway for our PALMS (Physical Activity Lifelong Modelling \& Simulation) agent-based micro-simulation that we developed in the UK, and how we use an Open Access Repository to share the outputs of the research.},

Bespoke academic projects provide little scope for repeatable practical application and efforts to develop generic reusable solutions have neither clearly identified the end users nor fully appreciated their multifaceted requirements. Influenced by a review of existing findings and recommendations in addition to a customised survey of prospective end users, a set of practical design principles were elicited in guiding development of a new open-source and versatile tool. Capturing variability in arrivals and length of stay as well as the stochastic nature of dynamic delays in patient discharge and transfer, the PathSimR tool can be used to model various user-defined configurations of outpatient and inpatient pathways. In addition to reporting on early use and engagement initiatives to promote the tool, this study also offers a blueprint for how simulation models can be developed and deployed within the healthcare setting.},

Three discrete event simulation models are provided to evaluate the resource requirements during the peak of the pandemic. First, we estimate the number of beds needed in the emergency department (ED). In the second model, we estimate the number of ambulances required to maintain prepandemic response times for emergency patients. The third model is a coupling of the two former models, and it is used to study the effects of ED boarding time for COVID-19 patients. The resource needs are analysed under different COVID-19 testing policies. A strict testing policy increases the bed requirements in the ED, while it has the opposite effect for ambulances. Two distinct mechanisms causing boarding time are found. The effects from boarding time are most prominent during night and weekends.},

Firstly, that generic models sacrifice the relative simplicity of a bespoke simulation model for flexibility. Secondly, that generic models are published in conceptual form only. If researchers cannot access computer implementation of models, then there is little incentive or benefit to recode one over coding a simpler bespoke simulation model. We introduce an incremental approach to generic modelling in discrete-event simulation. We develop an archetype setting-specific generic model of a hospital ward. The archetype model is first developed and applied in a rehabilitation ward setting. Then a second team applies the model in a specialised intensive care setting. We report the successes, obstacles and redevelopment needed for reuse of the generic model along with how the results of these studies were used to inform healthcare delivery.},

Given the vast scale of the health care modelling literature, a novel review methodology was adopted, similar in concept to the approach of stratified sampling. The results provide new insights into the level of activity across many areas of application, highlighting important relationships and pointing to key areas of omission and neglect in the literature. In addition, the approach presented in this article provides a systematic and generic methodology that can be extended to other application domains as well as other types of information source in health-care modelling.},

We present here RESTful-CD++, the first distributed simulation middleware based on REST (Representational State Transfer) Web-services. RESTful-CD++ middleware enables heterogeneous independent-developed simulation components to interoperate with much flexibility and simplicity. REST has the potential to advance distributed simulation state-of-the-art towards plug-and-play or automatic/semi-automatic interoperability. This because of its lightweight approach hides internal software implementation by using universal uniform interface and describing connectivity semantics in form of messages, usually XML. In contrast, other approaches expose functionalities in heterogeneous RPCs that often reflect internal implementation and describe semantics in form of procedure parameters. Further, REST enables simulations to mashup with Web 2.0 applications, which makes simulation in link with any device attached to the Web dynamically at runtime. The CD++ tool is now the first simulation engine to use RESTful middleware to perform distributed simulation in large-scale.},

The IDL interface definition may be implemented in Java by using different simulation algorithms, over different operating systems or hardware platforms. Simulation applications, developed as stand-alone Java applications or Java applets running within Web browsers, access the facility via the Internet inter-ORB protocol (IIOP) to obtain runtime support for model execution.
